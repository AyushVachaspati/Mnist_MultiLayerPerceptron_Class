# Mnist Multi Layer Perceptron
This was a project I did to try out tensorflow and get started in DeepLearning.
The Mnist class allows you to specify the number of layers and the number of 
cells in each layer.

The dataset is assumed to be present in dataset directory as:
mnist_train.csv,
mnist_test.csv

For usage see example.py.
